# BOOKWORM

Bookworm is an online book store where users can look for books based on the book genre. 

Deployed at: https://milestone-project-4-ana.herokuapp.com/

## UX

The store is designed to enable users to register, login and logout for data protection services. 

They can also see their order history and choose the "remember information" option, in order not to have to fill out their personal info at every purchase. 

Users can search for books based on genre (fiction and nonfiction), which is easily accessible at the top of the page.

The navigation bar also allows entails a search bar, which allows the user to search the store by a certain name or word. 


#### User Stories

As a user, I want:

- to have my data protected
- to have an easy access to my previous orders
- to search for books by category / genre


#### Wireframes

As there are many pages to this project, I have included the wireframes in a separate document.

Please see the wireframes.md file for the entire collection of wireframes:
